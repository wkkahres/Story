It was the best of aliens, it was the worst of space,
it was the age of planets, it was the age of the death star,
it was the epoch of epoch-ness, it was the epoch of black holes,
it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way â€“ in short,
the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received,
for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
